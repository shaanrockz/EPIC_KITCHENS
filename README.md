# EPIC-Kitchens
This project is the result of an attempt in EPIC-Kitchens Challenge. We choose TSN (Temporal Segment Networks) as a backbone for initial classification. Further I try to improve the result using various ways (listed below in Algorithms part), though didn't succeed much, but learnt alot! 

Here I want to share my repo which comprise of from scratch implementation (including some referred code) with fully integrated module for action classification workflow.

Backbone : Temporal Segment Networks (TSN) [1]

Algorithms [options to choose in config] on top of backbone:
    1. "ERM" : Vanila TSN
    2. "FSL" : Few Shot Learning [2]
    3. "IRM" : Invariant Risk Minimization [3]
    4. "MTGA": Multi-Task Learning as Multi-Objective Optimization [4]

Dataset : EPIC-KITCHENS Challenge [5]
    Dataset is downloaded in the form of frames. 
    [options to edit the annotation and raw files path in config]
    
How to run?
  python -W ignore main.py --config config.yaml
  
  (Edit config.yaml and config.py for trying various specifications)
